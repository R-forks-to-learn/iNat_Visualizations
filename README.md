**FOR BEGINNING CODERS:**

First you will need to download a R code editor, I highly recommend RStudio Desktop (download at https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/). 

Another option is to use a notebook like Kaggle.com, which is kind of nice as it does not require a download. However, these are a little more limited than an IDE like RStudio, and I am unsure if all the packages required in the code found here are avaliable in some notebooks.

I will only cover the basics for how to get started with RStudio below but if you would like to use a notebook there are many great resourses online.

Note: if this seems too complicated or time consuming feel free to email me at whimbrelbirders (at) yahoo (dot) com with your iNaturalist username and what visualizations you would like and I will give you a link to them on RPubs.

**GETTING STARTED WITH RSTUDIO:**

After you suscessfully complete the download, you will see a window for writing the script in the top left, type the following command in:

*install.packages("reactable")*

Next, click the green plus (with a document in the backgrond) button right under file in the top left corner. 
Now select, *"R Script"*, it sould now bring up a new script. You are now ready to copy and paste any of the code in this repository.
